# Obsidian Kickstart
This is a repository to easily start using Obsidian for Meeting Notes and to let these be converted to PDF files with custom design based on the intranda corporate design.

To use this Kickstart just open the Terminal in the root folder where a new Vault shall be created and execute the following commands there:

## Usage for intranda corporate design

```bash
# go to the Vault root folder
cd ~/my-vault-folder

# download the kickstarter files and unzip these here
wget https://github.com/SteffenHankiewicz/obsidian-kickstart/releases/latest/download/obsidian-intranda.zip -O o.zip
unzip o.zip
rm o.zip
```
